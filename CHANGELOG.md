# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-22
  
### Fixed
- Return `id_token` in /token response for Authorization Code Flow when `openid` scope is requested, as required by OIDC Core spec (Section 3.1.3.3)
- Include `nonce` claim in `id_token` when provided by the client

### Changed
- Use `pyproject.toml` as single source of truth for version number
- Remove outdated version label from Dockerfile

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Token endpoint now rejects requests when `client_id` cannot be determined from either the request body or the `Authorization` header
- Token endpoint now rejects requests where `client_id` in the body conflicts with the authenticated client in the `Authorization` header

### Added
- Tests for client_id mismatch and missing client_id edge cases

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Allow authorization code flow without `Authorization` header for PKCE public clients (RFC 6749 §2.1)
  - Libraries like authlib send `client_id` in the request body instead of the header when no client secret exists
  - Auth header validation is now only enforced for grant types other than `authorization_code`

### Added
- Test for PKCE plain flow without auth header (`test_pkce_plain_flow_no_auth_header`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish Docker images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
  - Triggered on version tags (`v*`), builds multi-platform images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)
  - `latest` tag published only for non-prerelease versions
- Docker usage instructions in README (`docker pull` and `docker run` examples)

### Changed
- Dockerfile healthcheck switched from Python `urllib` to `curl` for Podman compatibility and reduced overhead
- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6 in publish workflow

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml: replaced `curl` with Python's `urllib` for healthcheck — avoids adding `curl` as a system dependency in the image

### Docs
- Added mascotte/logo images to the project

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- New `strict_saml_binding` setting to enforce SAML 2.0 binding compliance
  - When `false` (default): lenient mode accepts GET with uncompressed data (useful for debugging)
  - When `true`: strict mode rejects non-compliant requests per SAML spec
- Setting exposed in UI (Settings page), REST API (`/api/config`), and MCP server
- Exclusive C14N (`exc_c14n`) is now the default XML canonicalization algorithm
  - Standard for SAML 2.0 signatures, handles namespace isolation correctly
  - Available algorithms: `exc_c14n` (Exclusive C14N 1.0, default), `c14n` (C14N 1.0), `c14n11` (C14N 1.1)
- UI select dropdown for C14N algorithm in Settings page
- `strict_saml_binding` and `verbose_logging` now persist correctly on save/reload
- Comprehensive E2E test coverage for all SAML flows in `test_agent.py`:
  - `test_saml_metadata_bindings` - verifies both HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect advertised
  - `test_saml_sso_post_binding` - SP-initiated SSO with HTTP-POST (InResponseTo verification)
  - `test_saml_sso_redirect_binding` - SP-initiated SSO with HTTP-Redirect (InResponseTo verification)
  - `test_saml_idp_initiated_not_supported` - documents IdP-initiated SSO is not supported
  - `test_saml_strict_binding_mode` - tests strict/lenient binding behavior
  - `test_saml_attribute_query_verification` - verifies actual attributes returned
- Unit tests for inline login flow (`test_inline_login_flow_preserves_post/redirect_binding`)
- Unit test for strict mode + inline login (`test_strict_mode_inline_login_preserves_redirect_binding`)
- Unit test for Exclusive C14N configuration (`test_c14n_algorithm_configurable_to_exclusive`)

### Fixed
- SAML SSO now correctly handles both HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings
- Parser always tries DEFLATE decompression first, falls back to raw XML (handles all edge cases)
- Strict mode now works with inline login by passing original HTTP verb via hidden field
  - Fixes: GET compressed → login form → POST would fail in strict mode
  - Stateless: no server-side session needed, works in CI/CD pipelines
- Explicit `|e` escape filter in login template hidden fields (XSS defense-in-depth)
- Normalized `original_verb` handling (uppercase, validated to GET/POST)
- Quick-fill username buttons use `tojson` filter to handle special characters safely

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- SAML SSO now correctly handles HTTP-POST binding (uncompressed SAMLRequest)
- Previously, `_parse_saml_request` unconditionally attempted DEFLATE decompression, causing parsing to fail for POST requests
- Now uses HTTP method to determine binding type: GET = HTTP-Redirect (compressed), POST = HTTP-POST (uncompressed)

### Changed
- E2E test agent now verifies actual SAML parsing (InResponseTo matching) instead of just endpoint availability
- Added separate tests for HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings in `test_agent.py`

### Changed (Architecture)
- **Inline login for SAML SSO**: `/saml/sso` now shows login form directly instead of redirecting to `/login`
  - This preserves SAML binding context naturally (no redirect = no method change)
  - Follows the pattern used by Keycloak and other IdPs
  - Removes the complex edge cases caused by redirect-based login
- `/login` endpoint simplified - now only used for direct web UI access, not SAML flows
- Login form now posts to current URL (no hardcoded action) - works for both `/login` and `/saml/sso`

### Changed
- SAML metadata now advertises both HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings for SingleSignOnService
- Audit stats now track SAML SSO and Attribute Query separately (`saml_sso_requests`, `saml_attribute_queries`)
- Dashboard shows combined SAML total with SSO/AttrQuery breakdown
- E2E test agent expanded to 35 tests (was 28), now covering all SAML flows with parsing verification

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Configurable `verbose_logging` setting to control sensitive data in logs
- `verbose_logging` exposed in MCP `get_settings` and `update_settings` tools
- `logging.verbose_logging` exposed in REST API `/api/config` endpoint
- MCP tests (`tests/test_mcp.py`) with 8 tests for MCP functionality
- Verbose logging test in E2E test agent

### Changed
- Replaced deprecated `defusedxml.lxml` with native lxml secure parser for XXE protection
- Added `html.escape` for XSS prevention in SAML responses
- Audit logging now respects `verbose_logging` setting (usernames/client_ids only when enabled)

### Security
- XXE (XML External Entity) protection using secure lxml parser configuration
- XSS prevention in SAML response forms
- Configurable sensitive data logging (verbose_logging defaults to true for dev convenience)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Configurable XML canonicalization algorithm via `saml.c14n_algorithm` setting

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Configurable SAML response signing via `saml.sign_responses` setting
- UI toggle for SAML signing in Settings page (`/settings`)
- `sign_responses` exposed in `/api/config` endpoint
- Test agent (`examples/test_agent.py`) for comprehensive endpoint testing

### Changed
- SAML SSO and AttributeQuery endpoints now respect `sign_responses` configuration
- Changed default XML canonicalization to C14N 1.0 for maximum compatibility
- Updated documentation with SAML signing configuration instructions
